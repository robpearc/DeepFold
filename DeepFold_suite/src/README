 *  A program for ab initio protein structure 
 *  prediction guided by potentials from deep 
 *  learning
 *
 *  This program was written by Robin Pearce at the Zhang Lab
 *  Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics 
 *  University of Michigan 
 *           
 *  Please report bugs and questions to robpearc@umich.edu

*******************************************************************************************/

To compile the program cd into the src directory and type g++ -static -std=c++0x -O3 -ffast-math -lm -o DeepFold Main.cpp

To run the program use the following command: ./DeepFold <datadir> <libdir>
where libdir is the library directory and datadir is the folder with the following files:
    seq.txt ----> The amino acid sequence in fasta format
    seq.dat.ss ----> The predicted secondary structure in PSI-PRED format
    phi.txt ----> predicted Phi torsion angles, which are used as restraints
    psi.txt ----> predicted Psi torsion angles, which are used as restraints

    ************ FILES GENERATED BY DEEPPOTENTIAL *****************
    DeepPotential_20.npz ----> The deep learning predicted distance/orientation restraints. In order for these
                             to be read by the program, you must first run 'python npz2txt.py <RESTRAINT_FILE>',
                             where RESTRAINT_FILE is the DeepPotential_20.npz file, to convert the distances into
                             txt files.
    DeepPotential_pca_20.txt ----> CA distances predicted by DeepPotential
    DeepPotential_cb_contact.txt ----> Predicted CB contacts
    DeepPotential_ca_contact.txt ----> Predicted CA contacts
    ***************************************************************

The predicted structure will be output in the current directory and named model.pdb
