                                  FAQ
1. How to use the program?
Usage: ./FASPR -i input.pdb -o output.pdb [-s sequence.txt]
-i: input a pdb backbone for packing. There should be no missing main-chain 
    atoms (N, CA, C and O). If side-chain atoms are included in input.pdb,
    they are ignored by FASPR.
-o: the repacked structure output by FASPR (in standard PDB format). The 
    residue positions are kept identical to the input pdb file
-s: (optionally) pack a new sequence on the backbone of the input.pdb file. 
    The sequence should be written as one-single line of one-letter alphabet 
    of amino acid types, e.g.:
    ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYYWVTSRQPNMLKIHGFEDCA
    for the input sequence, only 20 canonical amino acids are allowed.

#### NOTE ####
Please remember to put the executable FASPR program and the binary Dunbrack 
rotamer library 'dun2010bbdep.bin' in the same directory. Otherwise, the program 
will prompt "error! cannot find rotamer library dun2010bbdep.bin". Do not change
the name of 'dun2010bbdep.bin' because it is hard coded in the source code.

2. How to build the program for speed?
Build the executable program from the source code using the following command:
g++ --ffast-math -O3 -o FASPR src/*.cpp
or (if the above command does not work):
g++ -O3 -o FASPR src/*.cpp

3. In which OS can I run FASPR?
FASPR can be run in any OS if it is buit following the way as mentioned above.

4. Please report bugs to Dr. Xiaoqiang Huang at the above emails.

5. FASPR is open-source software under the MIT license.
